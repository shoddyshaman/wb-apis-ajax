"longDescription":"Only three centuries ago, setting out to climb a mountain would have been     considered close to lunacy. Mountains were places of peril, not beauty, an upper world     to be shunned, not sought out. Why do mountains now hold us spellbound, drawing us into     their dominion, often at the cost of our lives?    From Tibet to Australia, Alaska to Norway armed with drones, Go-Pros and helicopters,     director Jennifer Peedom has fashioned an astonishing symphony of mountaineers, ice climbers,     free soloists, heliskiers, snowboarders, wingsuiters and parachuting mountain bikers.     Willem Dafoe provides a narration sampled from British mountaineer Robert Macfarlane’s     acclaimed memoir Mountains of the Mind, and a classical score from the Australian Chamber     Orchestra accompanies this majestic cinematic experience."},

"description":"Coexisting but conflicting needs create self-sabotaging behaviors.&#xa0;This is why we resist efforts to change, often until they feel completely futile.&#xa0;But by extracting crucial insight from our most damaging habits, building emotional intelligence by better understanding our brains and bodies, releasing past experiences at a cellular level, and learning to act as our highest potential future selves, we can step out of our own way and into our potential.&#xa0;For centuries, the mountain has been used as a metaphor for the big challenges we face, especially ones that seem impossible to overcome.&#xa0;To scale our mountains, we actually have to do the deep internal work of excavating trauma, building resiliance, and adjusting how we show up for the climb.&#xa0;In the end, it is not the mountain we master, but ourselves."},

"description":"<b>#1 <i>NEW YORK TIMES <\/i>BESTSELLER • Everybody tells you to live for a cause larger than yourself, but how exactly do you do it? The author of&#xa0;<i>The Road to Character<\/i>&#xa0;explores what it takes to lead a meaningful life in a self-centered world.<\/b><br /><br /><b>“Deeply moving, frequently eloquent and extraordinarily incisive.”—<i>The Washington Post<\/i><\/b><br /><br /> Every so often, you meet people who radiate joy—who seem to know why they were put on this earth, who glow with a kind of inner light. Life, for these people, has often followed what we might think of as a two-mountain shape. They get out of school, they start a career, and they begin climbing the mountain they thought they were meant to climb. Their goals on this first mountain are the ones our culture endorses: to be a success, to make your mark, to experience personal happiness. But when they get to the top of that mountain, something happens. They look around and find the view . . . unsatisfying. They realize: This wasn’t my mountain after all. There’s another, bigger mountain out there that is actually <i>my<\/i> mountain.<br /><br /> And so they embark on a new journey. On the second mountain, life moves from self-centered to other-centered. They want the things that are truly worth wanting, not the things other people tell them to want. They embrace a life of interdependence, not independence. They surrender to a life of commitment.<br /><br /> In <i>The Second Mountain, <\/i>David Brooks explores the four commitments that define a life of meaning and purpose: to a spouse and family, to a vocation, to a philosophy or faith, and to a community. Our personal fulfillment depends on how well we choose and execute these commitments. Brooks looks at a range of people who have lived joyous, committed lives, and who have embraced the necessity and beauty of dependence. He gathers their wisdom on how to choose a partner, how to pick a vocation, how to live out a philosophy, and how we can begin to integrate our commitments into one overriding purpose.<br /><br /> In short, this book is meant to help us all lead more meaningful lives. But it’s also a provocative social commentary. We live in a society, Brooks argues, that celebrates freedom, that tells us to be true to ourselves, at the expense of surrendering to a cause, rooting ourselves in a neighborhood, binding ourselves to others by social solidarity and love. We have taken individualism to the extreme—and in the process we have torn the social fabric in a thousand different ways. The path to repair is through making deeper commitments. In <i>The Second Mountain,<\/i> Brooks shows what can happen when we put commitment-making at the center of our lives."},

"description":"Coexisting but conflicting needs create self-sabotaging behaviors. This is why we resist efforts to change, often until they feel completely futile. But by extracting crucial insight from our most damaging habits, building emotional intelligence by better understanding our brains and bodies, releasing past experiences at a cellular level, and learning to act as our highest potential future selves, we can step out of our own way and into our potential.&#xa0;<br /><br />For centuries, the mountain has been used as a metaphor for the big challenges we face, especially ones that seem impossible to overcome. To scale our mountains, we actually have to do the deep internal work of excavating trauma, building resilience, and adjusting how we show up for the climb.

"description":"Shakyamuni Gautama was an historical figure who lived in India from approximately 563 to 483 B.C. After his death, Buddhism spread over Asia, and almost 2,500 years later Buddhism has come to the West, where it is more relevant than ever. These four classic talks by John Daido Loori, abbot of Zen Mountain Monastery, offer a clear, comprehensive version of the Buddha's life and teachings, including Buddha's life as a householder, spiritual seeker, and ultimately a teacher. Roshi brings Buddha to life by describing how Buddha's personal struggles led to his search for greater meaning. Like many of us, Buddha felt dissatisfied with the daily routine of life, and he wanted to understand how to live authentically. Buddha's search led to his realization of the Four Noble Truths, which are essentially the awareness of suffering and how to alleviate it. Daido Roshi discusses the Four Noble Truths, and examines how this core Buddhist teaching is relevant to our lives today. He also explores how subsequent teachers carried on the Buddha's teachings, touching particularly on Zen Buddhist masters. These talks form a wonderful introduction for those completely new to Buddhism, while offering important insights to those who are already practicing.<br /><br />Zen Buddhism emphasizes zazen, or seated meditation, as the means to study the self and understand who we truly are. Dharma talks are an essential aspect of Zen training and take place in the context of zazen. Said to be \"dark to the mind and radiant to the heart\", a dharma talk is one of the ways in which a teacher points directly to the heart of the teachings of the Buddha. In our meditation practice, it is easy to get lost in self-doubt, fantasy, numbness, and emotional agitation. Dharma talks help to ground our practice, providing inspiration and an essential recognition of exactly where we find ourselves, so that we can learn to face difficulties and obstacles with a free and flexible mind. This talk was given at Zen Mo..."},

"description":"From FOX News anchor and author Harris Faulkner comes a collection of powerful, true-life stories of resilience, healing, rescue, and protection.<br /><br />We need reminders of God’s power now more than ever.<br /><br />We often think about prayer as a wish list, with God as Santa Claus. The reality is that the power of prayer reminds us not only how small we are, but also how big God is. Prayer is hope put into action. And prayer works.<br /><br />From the aftermath of the devastating earthquake in Haiti to the theater shooting in Aurora, Colorado, believers testify to how God inspired hope even when all seemed lost.<br /><br />Two teenagers who were saved from treacherous seas by a vessel named Amen now give thanks for the rescue that changed their lives. A woman’s near-death experience with COVID-19 turned out to be the crisis freeing her from despair. Others speak to how prayer helped them navigate family trauma, overcome abuse, and cope with mental illness and depression. Historical accounts of miracles testify to God’s power throughout time, and Faulkner recounts the role of faith and prayer in her own life and the life of her father.<br /><br />Along with these stories of God’s presence, the book includes newly written prayers. Created to reflect the current times, These prayers provide a road map for putting the lessons of these stories into action.<br /><br />Faith Still Moves Mountains reminds us that God’s light always shines through the darkness. Through these testimonies, we learn prayer isn’t just a ritual, it’s a vital spiritual strategy in a world that wants us to give up the fight.<br /><br />Supplemental enhancement PDF accompanies the audiobook."},

"description":"Experience the true “great outdoors” through the stories of the men who lived it. <br /><br />The “mountain men” were the hunters and trappers who fiercely strode the Rocky Mountains in the early to mid-1800s. They braved the elements in search of the skins of beavers and other wild animals, to sell or barter for goods. The lifestyle of the mountain men could be harsh, existing as they did among animals, and spending most of their days and nights living and camping out in the great unexplored wilds of the Rockies. Life outdoors presented many threats, not least among them Native Americans, who were hostile to the mountain men encroaching on the area for their own purposes. For a certain kind of pioneer, this risk and more were outweighed by the benefits of living free, without the restrictions and boundaries of “civilized” settlements. <br /><br />In <i>The Adventures of the Mountain Men<\/i>, editor Stephen Brennan has compiled many of the best stories about the mountain men - the most daring exploits, the death-defying chances taken to hunt big game, the clashes with the arrows of Native Americans, and also the moments when the men were struck by the incomparable beauty of the unsullied, majestic Rocky Mountains."},

Determined to navigate his final days on his own terms, he shares the news with no one - not even his daughter (Mira Sorvino) - instead traveling back to his boyhood home in Eastern Washington with only his dog in tow. But the journey does not go as planned; the familiar landscape triggers memories and a connection with a kind stranger (Annie Gonzalez) inspires new insight. Based on David Guterson's best-selling novel and unfolding against the scenic vistas of the Columbia Basin, this compelling character study offers a long-overdue showcase for one of cinema’s greatest treasures."},
